Advice on getting hired for Explorer or Software Engineering Intern roles at Microsoft. I was an explorer in the summer of 2016, SWE intern in 2017, and will be a SWE intern again in 2018.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a Microsoft recruiter, I can't get you hired here, and none of this advice is official. These are my own reflections based on personal experience; putting this at the top so I don't have to say "my personal opinion is..." in every sentence.

## Interview Process
So you've been contacted for an interview. This process begins in one of two ways: first with either a phone screen or a campus interview. Phone screens are typically non-technical or close-to-non-technical 30 minute conversations with a recruiter. See the section below for a sampling of questions. Campus interviews can be more technical despite being about the same amount of time; candidates are typically given an easy/moderate technical question by an engineer to solve in real time or to code and hand-in for future evaluation. It appears as though this is done mostly at target schools where there are large volumes of qualified candidates to sort through in short amounts of time.

## Scheduling
I recommend you schedule your phone screen no later than the third week of October, and fly-out final rounds to be completed no later than the first week of November. This advice is especially emphasized for candidates interviewing for the Explore program; there are only ~300 Explorer spots, while there are nearly 2000 SWE Intern spots. Explorer spots go very quickly; I've seen PLENTY of top students at top schools do exceptionally well in interviews only to be turned away because they waited until December to complete the rounds and all the spots got taken out from under them in the meantime. (Likewise, don't do this if you're seeking a PM role, either. Those figures are similar and as the PM program is extraordinarily competitive, I recommend not waiting.)

## Recruiters
Recruiters are your biggest ally in the hiring process. They're also exceptionally busy people. When emailing, put the point of your email in the first sentence -- then go into background detail if needed, just don't hide the punchline in the fifth paragraph of your email. It is acceptable to email your recruiter once a week; don't bug them excessively. If you're having trouble hearing back either way, email urcenter@microsoft.com and/or ask your friends for their recruiters' emails. More than anything, be gracious through this process and respect your recruiter's time.

## Interview Question Examples
**Phone Screen round**
1. What is your favorite technology and why?
2. What teams at Microsoft are you interested in and why?
3. How did you become interested in computer science?
4. What is a linked list?
5. What is your favorite language and why?

**Explore - PM-y questions (final rounds)**
Cracking the PM Interview is overdoing it, but good prep for future PM candidates (you will need to re-interview from Explore to be considered for a return offer in a PM role).
1. If you were given a keyboard, how would you test the keys?
2. How would you test a pen?
3. How would you design a calculator for a visually impared student?
4. How would you design a vending machine or a toaster?
5. You have a series of numbers from one to one million and there is a missing number; how would you find the missing number? (Solution can also be coded as part of the tech interviews)
6. In 2 to 3 minutes, explain a computer to a 5 year old who has seen a computer, but doesnâ€™t really understand what it is or does.
7. What is the difference between C and Java/between C and C# and how might this impact design decisions?

**Explore - Dev questions (final rounds)**
Cracking the Coding Interview is likely overdoing it, but good prep for future interviews elsewhere (note that Explorers interested in returning as a SWE Intern within the same team do not need to re-interview).
1. What is the best data structure for a phone book with names and phone numbers? Code an example solution and explain.
2. Print values in a doubly linked list in descending order.
3. Invert a binary search tree.
4. Sort an array, stack, and queue in arrays and linked lists.
5. Write a program that returns the acute angle between two hands on a clock.
6. If there is a line of people, how would you keep track of positions?
7. Remove duplicates in this list.
8. Reverse a string.

**SWE Intern questions (final rounds)**
Cracking the Coding Interview is good prep. Leetcode Hard is over-doing it.
1. Given two integers m and n, loop repeatedly through an array of m and remove each nth element. Return the last element left. (If m = 7 and n = 4, then begin with the array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and remove, in order, 4 1 6 5 2 7 and return 3.)
2. Given an array of 0's and 1's, move all of the 0's to the beginning of the array and all of the 1's to the end of the array. 
3. Write a function that accepts an m x n matrix (array) of random numbers, and use the functions row (times) 2 and column-1 to set the entire array to 0.
4. Solve a maze recursively.
5. The N Queens problem.
6. Keep track of the X most recent entries to a list without duplicates.
7. Find the longest palindrome in a string.

## Compensation
You can find all of this on Glassdoor, but for the sake of shoving all relevant information into one page -- current going offers for summer 2018 are:
1. Explorer Intern - Redmond
   - $31/hr
   - 40 hrs/week
2. Software Engineering Intern - First time @ Microsoft - Redmond
   - $7250/mo
3. Software Engineering Intern - Explore to SWE Intern conversion - Redmond
   - $7250/mo
   - $5000 gross starting bonus
4. Software Engineering Intern - Returning Microsoft SWE Intern (SWE Intern <--> SWE Intern) - Redmond
   - $7650/mo
   - $5000 gross starting bonus
   
Additionally, all Redmond interns receive free corporate housing OR a $4000 net housing stipend, a bus pass for the Seattle metro area, reimbursed gym membership, free healthcare (no dental for interns), access to the Connector shuttles to and from work, the Signature Event gift, and more.

After accounting for California taxes and cost of living differences, I feel that for internships, Microsoft HQ offers are marginally more competitive than Google HQ offers and on par with Facebook HQ offers.

## Signature Event
The sig event is a festival of activities and a concert every year held at a landmark venue in the Seattle metro area, and also the night the "intern gift" is given. Some examples; in 2016, the sig event was Ellie Goulding at Seattle Center (Space Needle and the Chihuly Museum were shut down for us) and the gift was a maxxed out Surface Book (retail ~$1900/person). In 2017, it was Daya and The Chainsmokers at the Boeing Factory/Museum/Runway in Mukilteo, and the gift was an Xbox (retail $250/person).
