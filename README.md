Advice on getting hired for Explorer or Software Engineering Intern roles at Microsoft. I was an explorer in the summer of 2016, SWE intern in 2017, and will be a SWE intern again in 2018.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a Microsoft recruiter, I can't get you hired here, and none of this advice is official. These are my own reflections based on personal experience; putting this at the top so I don't have to say "my personal opinion is..." in every sentence.

## Interview Process
So you've been contacted for an interview. This process begins in one of two ways: first with either a phone screen or a campus interview. Phone screens are typically non-technical or close-to-non-technical 30 minute conversations with a recruiter. See the section below for a sampling of questions. Campus interviews can be more technical despite being about the same amount of time; candidates are typically given an easy/moderate technical question by an engineer to solve in real time or to code and hand-in for future evaluation. It appears as though this is done mostly at target schools where there are large volumes of qualified candidates to sort through in short amounts of time.

## Scheduling
I recommend you schedule your phone screen no later than the third week of October, and fly-out final rounds to be completed no later than the first week of November. This advice is especially emphasized for candidates interviewing for the Explore program; there are only ~300 Explorer spots, while there are nearly 2000 SWE Intern spots. Explorer spots go very quickly; I've seen PLENTY of top students at top schools do exceptionally well in interviews only to be turned away because they waited until December to complete the rounds and all the spots got taken out from under them in the meantime. (Likewise, don't do this if you're seeking a PM role, either. Those figures are similar and as the PM program is extraordinarily competitive, I recommend not waiting.)

## Compensation
You can find all of this on Glassdoor, but for the sake of shoving all relevant information into one page -- current going offers for summer 2018 are:
1. Explorer Intern - Redmond
   - $31/hr
   - 40 hrs/week
2. Software Engineering Intern - First time @ Microsoft - Redmond
   - $7250/mo
3. Software Engineering Intern - Explore to SWE Intern conversion - Redmond
   - $7250/mo
   - $5000 gross starting bonus
4. Software Engineering Intern - Returning Microsoft SWE Intern (SWE Intern <--> SWE Intern) - Redmond
   - $7650/mo
   - $5000 gross starting bonus
   
Additionally, all Redmond interns receive free corporate housing OR a $4000 net housing stipend, a bus pass for the Seattle metro area, reimbursed gym membership, free healthcare (no dental for interns), access to the Connector shuttles to and from work, the Signature Event gift, and more.

After accounting for California taxes and cost of living differences, I feel that for internships, Microsoft HQ offers are marginally more competitive than Google HQ offers and on par with Facebook HQ offers.
